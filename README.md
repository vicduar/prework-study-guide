# prework-study-guide Webpage

## Description
To design a Prework Study Guide webpage

This prework study guide provided a basic example of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and how they interact with one another.

The study guide provides a place for note-taking for the prework.

I leared a great deal regaring: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Terminal, VS Code, Github, DevTools - and how all of these are key elements in creating a desired webpage.
